## Video Walkthrough

Here is a reminder on how to embed Loom videos on GitHub. Feel free to remove this reminder once you upload your README. 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Favorite applications
- Instagram: most acessible (personally), plenty of networking opportunities, very entertaining
- Gmail: good way to receive emails from brands, connecting professionally with employers, school, etc.
- Subway surfers: fast paced, good game to play when bored during my commute to school, very fun and engaging
- Youtube: variety of videos to watch when bored and/or when I want to be entertained, very versatile.

###App Idea: an app that gives fortunes and/or quotes of the day
- I currently have a daily fortune app on my phone that I look go to for guidance/advice for how I should live the day
- The app isn't very aesthetically/visually pleasing so I would like to implement something similar to our prework & to the daily fortune idea
- The user would press a button and it would generate a quote, advice, or a lesson that we should keep in mind for the day
- Possibly, I could incorporate an initial quesstionare where depending on if the user says they're having a good or bad day, etc., the daily fortunes would vary to cater to their current situations.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- It was just a bit difficult to navigate XCode at first, since it's not something I'm use to using/encountering
- I wasn't completely sure what I was doing when writing in the ViewController file (Swift)
- recording the gif (video walkthrough) was the most difficult, since it was a bit frustrating to do
